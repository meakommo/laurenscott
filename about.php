                        <p>I am a kiwi born and raised, I went to Western Springs College and then worked in Accounts for 10 years. However, this was not where my passion lay as I enjoy helping people which is what attracted me to midwifery. In my younger years, I was very into my sports and very competitive (I have two older brothers so had to be!). These days I am not playing many organised sports however I do enjoy keeping active by going to the gym and to the beach whenever possible.</br></br>

                        When I am not helping women and their families I am usually spending time with my partner Kale and our family, watching the newest TV shows on Netflix, or playing some computer games with friends – I’m a little bit nerdy! I enjoy having a good laugh, and I also love a good dad joke, time to get started on those dad jokes now guys!!</br></br></p>
<p>I like to think of myself as an open minded person, especially when it comes to midwifery and women’s choice. It is my main aim to help you achieve the best experience possible for your pregnancy, birth and after the baby is born and what a wonderful life changing experience it truly is that you’re about to undertake. It is my privilege to walk this journey with families through pregnancy, birth and becoming parents. With current research based knowledge and training through my BHSc (Midwifery) qualification, youthful energy and caring nature, my care offers a balanced approach between research and holistic knowledge always keeping the woman, baby and her family at the centre of my care. I believe in empowering women and supporting their informed choices around her pregnancy, birth and in caring for her newborn. I believe that most women can safely give birth without intervention but I work closely with the staff at Waitakere Hospital and  should your pregnancy require any medical input. I will work in partnership with you to plan your care.
                </p></br>
                <p>I am happy to support all birth choices including drug free, waterbirth, vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) and Epidural. As I live in <strong>West Auckland</strong> I primarily work out of Waitakere Hospital, however if your care requires it I will support you to birth at North Shore Hospital. When I am not working I am spending time with my fiancé and our family and friends, usually with food involved as I am a bit of a foodie. I have a wicked sense of humour and love to have a good laugh.
                </p></br>
                <p>If you think we sound like a good match, please get in touch through the contact me page or text me on 0277002070 for an appointment. I hope to hear from you soon!
