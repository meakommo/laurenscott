WIP

This is a website that I made for my fiance to help people find information about her if they googled her name looking for a Midwife.

While the site is working I plan to improve upon it.

The website is built primarily with PHP however it does us JavaScript to perform some tasks.

The design is done using Bootstrap and material-ui
