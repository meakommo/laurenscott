                <h2><strong>Congratulations on your pregnancy!</strong></h2> <p> What a wonderful life changing experience you’re about to undertake. It is my privilege to walk this journey with families through pregnancy, birth and becoming parents. With current research based knowledge and training through my BHSc (Midwifery) qualification, youthful energy and caring nature, my care offers a balanced approach between research and holistic knowledge always keeping the woman, baby and her family at the centre of my care. I believe in empowering women and supporting their informed choices around her pregnancy, birth and in caring for her newborn. I believe that most women can safely give birth without intervention but I work closely with the staff at Waitakere Hospital and  should your pregnancy require any medical input. I will work in partnership with you to plan your care.
                </p>
                <p>I am happy to support all birth choices including drug free, waterbirth, vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) and Epidural. As I live in <strong>West Auckland</strong> I primarily work out of Waitakere Hospital, however if your care requires it I will support you to birth at North Shore Hospital. When I am not working I am spending time with my fiancé and our family and friends, usually with food involved as I am a bit of a foodie. I have a wicked sense of humour and love to have a good laugh.
                </p>
                <p>If you think we sound like a good match, please get in touch through the contact me page or text me on 0277002070 for an appointment. I hope to hear from you soon!
